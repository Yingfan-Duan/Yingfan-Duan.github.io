# Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training。

## Supervised/Unsupervised Learning 

### Supervised Learning 

- the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called **labels**
- 
- most important supervised learning algorithms：
  - k-Nearest Neighbors 
  - Linear Regression 
  - Logistic Regression 
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests 
  - Neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning 



### Semi-supervised Learning 

- deal with data that’s partially labeled；plenty of unlabeled instances, and few labeled instances
- example
  - photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos
  - 

### Reinforcement Learning

## Batch vs Online Learning 

### Batch Learning 

- 

### Online Learning 

## Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning 

### Instance-Based Learning 

### Model-Based Learning

# Main Challenges of Machine Learning

- **Insufficient quantity of training data** 

- **Non representative Training Data**
