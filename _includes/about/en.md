Hi, I am Yingfan Duan. ðŸ¥°

I am an enthusiastic data scientist. My current interests of data science range from data preprocessing and visualization to various machine learning models based on python. I used R mainly several years ago, working on visualization, web-scraping, data preprocessing and building shiny app.  I also have experience of big data platforms such as Hadoop, PySpark and GCP and I am still learning AWS. 

I currently am a master student in [UChicago](https://professional.uchicago.edu/lp/master-science-analytics-all-programs/rfi?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=branded&utm_term=master%20of%20science%20analytics&gclid=CjwKCAjw0a-SBhBkEiwApljU0q2oSCmbOij4itRgjZ6C8BDt4eTZJpxJoeaDV5Z9V1cXlZs_AG8GxhoC6lcQAvD_BwE), majoring in Analytics. I studied BS, Applied Statistics at [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://www.cufe.edu.cn/) in China. 

In the past, I worked as data science intern at Nielsen and Accenture for two months respectively. And I am going to be a summer intern in Expedia Group this summer.
